Particle picking from 2D micrographs remains a challenging early step in the Cryo-EM pipeline due to the diversity of particle shapes and the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of micrographs. Because of these issues, significant human intervention is often required to generate a high-quality set of particles for input to the downstream structure determination steps."],"metadata":{"id":"7ySia0wRFAEv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Imports**"],"metadata":{"id":"_z_MewpRMKF7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import os\n","import cv2"],"metadata":{"id":"ZRbcfZyBMON8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681790387092,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":128,"user":{"displayName":"zac lipperd","userId":"11300311766007752753"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Mounting and import data sets**\n","\n","The datasets used for the training and testing are stored in a google drive\n","\n","cryo-EM Micrographs that been used in this repostory have been collected from:\n","\n","\n","*  'Apoferritin' The first dataset is \"EMPIAR-10146\"- Apoferritin tutorial dataset for cisTEM, Dataset description is avaliable in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/entry/10146/#&gid=1&pid=1 (This appears to be a decreptid set as the data can no longer be accesed from this link)\n","*   'Beta-galactosidase' The second dataset has both Top and Side-view called (KLH), the KLH Dataset is available Online, http://nramm.nysbc.org/.\n","*   'Ribosome' The third datatset has shape that is considered as an irregularly shaped protein, EMPIAR-10028-80S ribosome, the dataset is downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/entry/10028/\n","*   'KLH' The fourth dataset has complex protein particle shapes (EMPIAR-10017-Beta-galactosidase), the dataset is downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/empiar/entry/10017/\n","\n","All four data sets will be imported to a single 'dataset' object.
