The image is first flattened into a one-dimensional vector. The range of intensity values is then divided into equal intervals, with the number of intervals corresponding to the number of desired clusters. These intervals serve as the initial clusters.\n","\n","For each pixel in the image, the method calculates the absolute difference between the pixel's intensity value and the representative values of the clusters (the mid-points of the intervals). The pixel is assigned to the cluster with the smallest difference.\n","\n","This process is repeated for all pixels in the image, creating a list of clusters, where each cluster contains the intensity values of the pixels that belong to it.\n","\n","for each cluster, a binary mask is created. In the mask, pixels that belong to the cluster are assigned a unique identifier (i.e., the cluster index plus one), and all other pixels are assigned a value of zero. The binary masks are returned as the output of the function, providing a segmented version of the original image.\n","\n","This method is akin to a manual implementation of k-means clustering, where the initial centroids are equally spaced across the range of intensity values. However, unlike k-means, this method does not involve any iterative updating of the centroids. The clusters are determined solely based on the initial partitioning of the intensity range.\n","\n","this custom clustering method may prove effective for certain types of images, particularly when the intensity values of different regions of the image are distinctly separated.
