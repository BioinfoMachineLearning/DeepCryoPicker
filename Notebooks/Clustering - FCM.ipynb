It's a method of clustering that allows a single data point (in this case, a pixel) to belong to multiple clusters.\n","\n","In FCM, each pixel in the image is assigned a membership value for each cluster, representing the degree to which the pixel belongs to the cluster. This is in contrast to hard clustering methods like K-means, where each pixel is assigned to exactly one cluster.\n","\n","The FCM algorithm works by initializing a fuzzy partition matrix with random values between 0 and 1. This matrix represents the initial membership degrees of the pixels for each cluster. The algorithm then iterates through two main steps until convergence:\n","\n","\n","1.   Compute the cluster centers: The center of each cluster is calculated as a weighted average of all pixels, where the weights are the membership degrees of the pixels for the cluster.\n","2.   Update the membership degrees: The degree to which each pixel belongs to each cluster is updated based on the distance between the pixel and the cluster center. Pixels closer to a cluster center will have a higher membership degree for that cluster.\n","\n","The result of the FCM algorithm is a set of membership matrices for each cluster, which can be used to generate a segmented image. Each pixel in the segmented image can be labeled according to the cluster for which it has the highest membership degree, or the membership degrees themselves can be used to create a fuzzy segmented image.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: scikit-fuzzy in c:\\users\\zacli\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (0.4.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=0.9.0 in c:\\users\\zacli\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from scikit-fuzzy) (1.10.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: networkx>=1.9.0 in c:\\users\\zacli\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from scikit-fuzzy) (3.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.6.0 in c:\\users\\zacli\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from scikit-fuzzy) (1.23.5)\n","Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4; however, version 23.1.2 is available.\n","You should consider upgrading via the 'c:\\Users\\zacli\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.\n"]}],"source":["pip install scikit-fuzzy"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YA20_AZrdlxb"},"source":["**Imports**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1337,"status":"ok","timestamp":1683854190843,"user":{"displayName":"zac lipperd","userId":"11300311766007752753"},"user_tz":300},"id":"PCsCcL3uthsP"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import skfuzzy as fuzz\n","import cv2\n","import os\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5mGfpqM7drMk"},"source":["**Setup Directory Paths**\n","\n","Path - location of raw datasets\n","\n","path_output - where preprocessed images will be saved"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1683854209910,"user":{"displayName":"zac lipperd","userId":"11300311766007752753"},"user_tz":300},"id":"DB2Nmhhw-isW"},"outputs":[],"source":["#drive path to directory containg datasets\n","path = \"../Data Sets/Processed Datasets\"\n","\n","#drive path to output directory for preprocessed_data\n","path_output = \"../Data Sets/Clustered Datasets\""]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ADsJS-tFdyk7"},"source":["**Import data to dictonary**\n","\n","Imports images to a dicontary of format dataset[folder]->Image"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ESTBN8x2d7ro"},"source":["**Reshape Images**\n","\n","Reshape images to have a consistint shape via adding downsizing and padding\n","\n","clustering expects images to have a standard size"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1683854366499,"user":{"displayName":"zac lipperd","userId":"11300311766007752753"},"user_tz":300},"id":"0DG4OoALkJLV"},"outputs":[],"source":["def resize_image(image, target_size):\n","    height, width = image.shape[:2]\n","    target_height, target_width = target_size\n","\n","    #
